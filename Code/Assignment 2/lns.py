# Destroy Method 1
"""
The `destroy_increased_random_shifts` function is implemented to disrupt nurse rosters by selectively removing shifts 
and adjusting the destruction parameters dynamically. This function supports multiple destruction strategies in one 
method, including weighted destruction based on shift type, a gradual increase in destroyed shifts, and larger 
contiguous block removals. Together, these mechanisms give the algorithm flexibility to explore a wide variety of 
roster configurations while balancing randomness with control.

Key Implementation Aspects:
1. **Weighted Random Destruction (First Pass)**:
   - Shift types ('A', 'P', 'N', 'F') are given specific weights to determine which shifts are more likely to be destroyed. 
   - A small randomness factor is added to these weights to vary destruction patterns between iterations, introducing 
     flexibility into which shifts are destroyed.
   - Shifts specified in `avoid_shifts` are excluded, ensuring critical assignments remain undisturbed, which helps 
     maintain the rosterâ€™s essential structure.

2. **Multiplicative Destruction Factor (Second Pass)**:
   - In this pass, a defined number of additional small blocks are destroyed, with each block lasting 1-2 days.
   - The `mult_factor` determines the increase in the total number of destroyed shifts beyond the initial rate.
   - This second pass amplifies shift removal selectively, adding significant variation but keeping the damage controlled.

3. **Contiguous Block Destruction (Third Pass)**:
   - After initial and multiplicative destructions, a larger block is destroyed for each nurse, with the length of the 
     block adjusted based on the already-destroyed parts of their schedule. 
   - The function calculates `min_period_length` and `max_period_length` dynamically, preventing excessive roster damage.
   - This step diversifies the solution space by enabling more substantial roster changes, helping escape repetitive patterns.

Together, these destruction phases offer a balanced approach to exploring the search space, where each pass 
complements the others. In the main `large_neighbourhood_search` (LNS) function, parameters such as destruction rate 
and block length can be adjusted when specific thresholds (like cost values) are reached, letting the algorithm 
intensify destruction only when needed. Overall, `destroy_increased_random_shifts` gives fine-grained control 
over the destructiveness applied to the roster.

# Destroy Method 2
"""
The `destroy_consecutive_work_off_blocks_with_dict` function was implemented as a strategic
approach to disrupt the nurse roster by selectively destroying blocks of consecutive work shifts
(A, P, N) followed by off-duty (F) days for each nurse. This design introduces variability into
the search space by targeting specific patterns, thereby helping the algorithm escape local minima.
The method maintains certain scheduling structures while allowing alternative solutions to emerge.

Key Implementation Aspects:
1. **Use of Dictionary Conversion**: To enhance flexibility, this function utilizes `convert_string_to_dict` to 
   transform the string-based roster into a dictionary format, allowing precise targeting and manipulation of specific 
   blocks. After modifications, it uses `convert_dict_to_string` to revert the schedule back to a usable format.

2. **Selective Block Targeting**: The function specifically destroys work-off sequences (work blocks
   immediately followed by off-duty blocks) instead of randomly removing shifts. This maintains the 
   schedule's natural structure and provides controlled variability in the optimization process.

3. **Controlled Destruction Limits**: Minimum and maximum block lengths are defined to avoid 
   excessive disruption and maintain feasible rosters. The block length also adjusts dynamically 
   based on the already destroyed sections, ensuring the method remains balanced.

4. **One-time Targeted Destruction**: To avoid over-destruction, only one work-off block combination 
   is processed per nurse, providing structured change to the schedule and minimizing repair complexity.

5. **Random Additional Block Destruction**: An additional pass is included to introduce minor 
   random destruction, further diversifying the solution without overwhelming randomness.

This function provides a practical balance between roster flexibility and structure preservation, 
ensuring effective exploration while keeping repairs manageable.

# Destroy Method 3
"""
The `destroy_every_few_days_with_comparison` function introduces targeted variability into the roster by 
destroying a specified range of days after every block of consecutive workdays. Unlike random destruction, 
this method uses `compared_indices`â€”the indices identified from differences between the best and second-best 
solutions in the previous iteration of the Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS)â€”to avoid or prioritize certain indices, 
bringing more informed randomness to the process.

Key Implementation Aspects:
1. **Comparison-Based Destruction**: `compared_indices`, which stores indices where the best and second-best 
   solutions differ, guides the destruction process. This approach maintains promising parts of the roster 
   while exploring changes in sections with potential for improvement.

2. **Controlled Skip and Destroy Blocks**: The function skips controlled amount of consecutive workdays (randomized with 
   `rand_min` and `rand_max`) before destroying a specified range (defined by `min_num` and `max_num`). This adds balance 
   by alternating between workdays and destruction intervals.

3. **Additional Randomized Destruction**: To introduce further diversity, the function performs an additional 
   block destruction on a few randomly selected days. This adds robustness to the search space exploration 
   while maintaining a manageable repair complexity.

This function helps the algorithm focus on key areas for improvement while preventing excessive disruption, 
making the repair phase more efficient.
