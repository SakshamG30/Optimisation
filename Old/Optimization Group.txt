Hi teaching team,

I, Saksham Gupta (u7726995), and I want to team up with Tohfa (uXXXXXXX) and Arslan (uXXXXXXX) to do the seminar in a group.

Our chosen seminar topic is Multi-Agent Path Planning.

We plan to cover four parts in the seminar:

Introduction to pathfinding (referencing paper 1).
Advanced path planning techniques for dynamic environments (referencing paper 2).
Application of path planning in real-time strategy games (referencing paper 3).
Collaborative and distributed path planning for multi-agent systems (referencing paper 4).
